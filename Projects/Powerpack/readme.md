## What is Powerpack?

The powerpack is a mini CMS developed with the ZN framework. <br>
The purpose of this package is to give developers some insight into the use of ZN and to lay the groundwork for developing a higher-level CMS. <br>
The pakette has been kept away from possible external preparations. <br>
Because the package is to give an idea about the use of structures belonging to the basic purpose ZN. <br>
The package development will continue depending on the situation.
